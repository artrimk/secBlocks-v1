# secBlocks-v1
Secure Building Blocks -
The source code for the novel secure building blocks based on arithmetic circuits such as: secure sum of slots of blocks (secSum), secure random ciphertext permuatation (SRCPer),
secure comparison (secComp), secure Comparison of All Data Slots (SCADS), secure argmax (secArgmax), secure ciphertext packing (CPack), etc.

Open the solution using Visual Studio 2017. Set the SEALExamples as the start-up project. The implementation uses Microsoft's SEAL library v3.2 found in https://github.com/microsoft/SEAL. For better communication and computation costs (performances), run the code in Release mode.
